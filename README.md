Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

There are three parts of the program:
1. Readme.md which briefly describes the contents of this project
2. CodeBook.md Describes the data and process of tidying data.
3. run_analysis.R R program to implement the required tidying of data the output of which is submitted separately
